## Network-Attack-detection-and-Prevention

#### Developed a end to end system to detect intrusions like DDOS, TCP SYN flooding, ARP spoofing, Smurf DOS, Nmap and others and to take actions according to some predefined rules.<br>
Used Snort, tcpdump and Grok-Exporter in the client machines as a packet sniffer and data collection.<br> Used Prometheus and Grafana for server to monitor events and alerting. <br>On the server, we have a configuration file for prometheus which is ‘prometheus.yml.’


Prometheus is run using “./server.sh”
On Grafana, the dashboard has to be imported from the json file present.
On client, we have:
1. `agent.yml` => Configuration for grok-exporter
2. `generatelog.sh` => To start generating logs.
3. `rungrok.sh` => To run grok exporter.
4. `promAlertAPI.py` => To run the Alert Webhook which will detect attack and add
iptables rule to block attackers IP.
5. `netlog.txt` => This will be generated by generatelog.sh which will be picked up by
grok-exporter.

### Installation of tools:
1. Grafana: Using apt install grafana
2. Prometheus:
It can be downloaded and set up from here:
https://linuxhint.com/install-prometheus-on-ubuntu/
3. TCPDump: Using apt install tcpdump
4. Grok-Exporter: Using the github repository: https://github.com/fstab/grok_exporter
### Running:
1. ./server.sh
2. sudo systemctl start grafana
3. On client: ./rungrok.sh
4. On client: ./generatelog.sh
5. On client: ./promAlertAPI.py
6. The parameters need to be changed for Ip address.
